["index.html", "A Introduction to R Welcome", " A Introduction to R Alex Douglas November 24, 2019 Welcome The purpose of this guide is to introduce you to using R, a modern, interactive environment for statistical computing and research. R in itself is not difficult to learn, but just like any new language the initial learning curve can be a little steep and you will need to use it frequently otherwise it’s easy to forget. A few notes about the course and this guide. Although you can use this guide as a standalone resource, I recommend you use it in conjunction with the companion course website. The course website contains a series of exercises for you to practice your coding and test your understanding of key concepts. You will also find R code for the exercise solutions and a plethora of links to additional resources. I suggest you work through the exercises during the course and encourage you complete these in your own time - you certainly won’t learn how to use R by watching other people do it. In this guide I have tried to simplify the content as much as possible and have based it on my own personal experience of teaching (and learning!) R over the last 15 years. It is not intended to cover everything there is to know about R - that would be an impossible task. Neither is it intended to be an introductory statistics course, although you will be using some simple statistics to highlight some of R’s capabilities. The main aim of this course is to help you climb the initial learning curve in a supportive and relaxed environment and provide you with the basic skills to enable you to further your experience in using R. There may be times when things get a little tough or frustrating (especially for those who have little or no experience of using the command line), however try to stick with it, the time and energy you invest now will be utterly transformative to your research. Finally, once you have finished this course, I encourage you to practice what you have learned on your own data. If you don’t have any data yet, then ask your supervisor or friends for some (I’m sure they will be delighted!) or follow one of the many excellent tutorials available online (see the course website for more details). My suggestion to you, is that while you are getting to grips with R, uninstall any other statistics software you have on your computer and only use R. This may seem a little extreme but will hopefully remove the temptation to ‘just do it quickly’ in a more familiar environment and consequently slow down your learning of R. Believe me, anything you can do in your existing statistics software package you can do in R (often better and more efficiently). Good luck and have don’t forget to have fun. "],

Installing R in Windows Installing R in other operating systems Starting R on a University of Aberdeen network PC The R console", " Introduction What is R? R is a statistical analysis environment initially created and developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1996. It can be regarded as an implementation of the S language, which was developed at Bell Laboratories by Rick Becker, John Chambers and Allan Wilks. R can be used both as a programming language and as a software package which you can use to manipulate your data, perform calculations, conduct statistical analyses and display graphics. Some advantages of using R include R is open source, platform agnostic and freely available. R has an extensive and coherent set of tools for statistical analysis. R has an extensive and highly flexible graphical facility capable of producing publication quality figures. R has an expanding set of freely available ‘packages’ of routines for special or unusual analyses. R has an extensive support network with numerous online and freely available documents. However, for those who haven’t used it before, R may seem rather daunting and complex. Whilst the initial learning curve is admittedly a little steep, R offers the user a degree of flexibility and control not usually available in other more traditional ‘point and click’ statistical software. Undoubtedly, the time invested in learning R now will be more than repaid at a later date. Most importantly, learning to use R will change the way you think about data analysis. As your analysis will be implemented using R code and R scripts you will always have a permanent and accurate record of your analytical approach which you can then make available to others to facilitate robust and reproducible research practices. Installing R in Windows Most people using this guide will be running R on a computer with a Windows operating system (for other operating systems see the next section or the R-project web site). R can be downloaded as a self-extracting file from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website Click on ‘Windows’, click on ‘base’ and then ‘Download R 3.6.1 for Windows’ (the version available whilst writing this guide). Double click on the downloaded R executable file and follow the on screen instructions. Full installation instructions can be found at the CRAN website. Although various contributed packages are now included with the standard R distribution, you may need to install other packages to perform particular analyses (see section 1.8 for details of how to do this). Installing R in other operating systems One of the great things about R is that it’s compatible with many operating systems. You can download the appropriate binary for MAC OSX here. On Bio-Linux, the good news is that R is already installed by default so there is no need to do anything! For other Linux distributions you can find installation instructions here and follow the ‘Download R for Linux’ hyperlink. Starting R on a University of Aberdeen network PC First, log onto the University network using your usual username and password. Double click on the Life Science and Medicine folder on the Desktop, then the Biological Sciences folder and finally to the Zoology folder. Shortcuts to both R, and RStudio (more later) should be visible. Double click on either to start the program. The R console In Windows, once you have started R you will see the standard graphical user interface (GUI). In other operating systems the layout will vary, but all the essential elements are similar. The GUI is rather spartan with a limited number of menu and toolbar commands (Figure 1.1). "],

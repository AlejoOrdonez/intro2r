# Graphics in R

For many people, one of their favourite uses of `R` is in making figures. These can either take the form of a quick dirty plot to allow you to get a feel for what's going on in your dataset, or fancier/more complex figures to use in a publication or report. This process is often as close as many analysts/scientists get to having a professional creative side (at least that's true for me), and it's something which those folk take great pride in.

As stated in the introduction, one of the many reasons for the rise in the popularity of `R` is due to it's ability to produce publication standard figures (as well as those quick and dirty figures - which are the type you and I and everyone else will produce most of). Not only can R users make figures well suited for publication, but producing figures in `R` allows for lots of customisation, in turn allowing users to create their own particular styles and brands of figures (well beyond the beyond cookie-cutter styles in more traditional click and point programs). Because of this inherent flexibility when producing figures, the data visualisation side of R and supporting packages has grown substantially over the years.

In this chapter, we will focus on two methods to produce figures in `R`. The first will be using the base `R` route and the second will be through using a package called `ggplot2`.

### Where did ggplot2 come from

(Think I want this removed. Debatable if reader would care about this and want to have screen space taken up)

Before we get going with making some plots of the gg variety, how about a quick little history of the most commonly used packages in R? `ggplot2` was based on a book called _Grammar of Graphics_ (hence the `gg` in `ggplot2`) by Leland Wilkinson [yours for only £100 or so](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447). But before you spend £100 see [here](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v017b03/v17b03.pdf) for an interesting summary of Wilkinson's book. 

Briefly, Wilkinson's idea (one of them anyway) in _grammar of graphics_ was that figures can be broken down into consituent parts, such as layers (more on this later). While Wilkinson would eventually go on to become vice-president of SPSS, his (and his co-author's) ideas would, never-the-less, make their way into R. 

In 2007 `ggplot2`was officially released by Hadley Wickham. By 2017 the package was said to have been downloaded 10,000,000 times. `ggplot2` now has many secondary packages that use it either as a foundation for expanding on or for interfacing (some statistical packages now have accompanying `ggplot2` interfaces for producing figures).

It is important to note here that `ggplot2` is not required to make "fancy" figures. If you'd prefer to ue base R then go ahead. Exactly equivalent figures are possible in base R. The difference between`ggplot2` and base is to do with how you _get_ to the end product rather than any differences in the end product itself. This is, never-the-less, a common belief almost certainly due to the fact that making a moderately attractive figure is easier to do with `ggplot2` as many decisions are made for the user, without you necessarily even knowing that a decision was ever made!

With that in mind, let's get started.

#### Quick scatterplots

#### Base R

(Using cars dataset as placeholder data)

In base R, the `plot()` function is the workhorse. Flexible

```{r, base R scatterplot starting-figure, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align="center"}
data(mtcars) # placeholder data
names(mtcars)
plot(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$hp)
```

#### ggplot2

```{r, qplot scatterplot starting-figure, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align="center"}
qplot(y = mpg, x = hp, data = mtcars)
```
